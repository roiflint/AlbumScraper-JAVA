# AlbumScraper-JAVA
Given a root directory of artists, the program searches wikipedia for missing albums

Before first run, edit config file.
-Enter artists folder directory.
-Enter sender gmail mail and password.
-Enter receiver mail.

If there are errors with mail try to turn off sender 2-step authentication and allow less secure app access in gmail account settings.

Currently there are few bands that recieve bad output do to wikipedia different page format.


This is still a work in progress.
